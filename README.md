# Friends-EDA
*This is still a work in progress! Check back soon when its completed

I came across this Dataset on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/bcruise/friends-episode-data?select=friends_imdb.csv). Being a huge fan of the show (I've watched it at least 10 times), this was an opportunity I couldn't do without. The Dataset consists of the viewership data and IMDb data, episode numbers and titles are provided for easy reference. I used Python and Jupyter Notebook to do some Exploratory Data Analysis on the 2 datasets.

Enjoy!
